    In general, if you pass in 'k' splits, you'll get back 'k+1' dataset
    objects. If the splits sum to 1.0, then passing in 'k' splits will return
    'k' datasets.

    The intuition behind the two different use cases is as follow: if you pass
    in a set of splits that sum to 1.0, you want to clearly (and explicitly)
    define how much data each dataset will end up with (as a portion of the
    whole dataset). In contrast, passing in a set of splits that don't sum to
    1.0 follows the logic of taking a dataset and 'stripping off' certain
    amounts for other purposes.
